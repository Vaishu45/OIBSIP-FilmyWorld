           <h2>About US </h2>
           <p>Movies are made to entertain audiences, and movie websites are much the same. In order to get visitors' attention and encourage them to see the movie, a website needs to give them what they are looking for and provide some entertainment at the same time. Today's movie websites make it easy to take a couple minutes and watch a few trailers before deciding which movie to see.
